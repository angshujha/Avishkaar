**Workflow Summary**
1. Patient logs in (JWT Auth)  
2. Uploads report (PDF/Image)  
3. `multer` handles upload  
4. `sharp` compresses image  
5. AI/OCR extracts prescription text  
6. MongoDB Atlas stores data  
7. Patient organizes reports in vault  
8. Patient generates QR/OTP  
9. Doctor scans QR → temporary access  
10. Access logs maintained
